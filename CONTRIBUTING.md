# Contributing to DECADA Embedded

decada-embedded-example-* are open-source real-time operating system examples to connect to the government IoT cloud. Contributions are an important part of the DECADA Embedded ecosystem, and our goal is to make it as simple as possible to become a contributor.

To encourage productive collaboration, as well as robust, consistent and maintainable code, we have a set of guidelines for [contributing to DECADA Embedded](https://www.siot.gov.sg/core-products/decada-embedded/decada-embedded-contribution/).
